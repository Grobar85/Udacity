			<p>The boa constrictor (Boa constrictor), also called the red-tailed boa or the common boa,
				is a species of large, heavy-bodied snake that is frequently kept and bred in captivity.
				The boa constrictor is a member of the family Boidae, found in tropical North, Central,
				and South America, as well as some islands in the Caribbean.
				A staple of private collections and public displays, its color pattern is highly variable yet distinctive.
				Ten subspecies are currently recognized, although some of these are controversial.
				This article focuses on the species Boa constrictor as a whole, and on the nominate subspecies B. c. constrictor.</p>
